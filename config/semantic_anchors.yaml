    Splicing of mammalian precursor transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules involves two enzymatic steps.
    First, intron removal by the tRNA splicing endonuclease generates separate 5' and 3' exons.
    In animals, the second step predominantly entails direct exon ligation by an elusive RNA ligase.
    Using activity-guided purification of tRNA ligase from HeLa cell extracts, we identified HSPC117,
    a member of the UPF0027 (RtcB) family, as the essential subunit of a tRNA ligase complex.
    RNA interference-mediated depletion of HSPC117 inhibited maturation of intron-containing pre-tRNA
    both in vitro and in living cells. The high sequence conservation of HSPC117/RtcB proteins is
    suggestive of RNA ligase roles of this protein family in various organisms.

    RNA cleavage by some endoribonucleases and self-cleaving ribozymes produces RNA fragments with
    5'-hydroxyl (5'-OH) and 2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini. To identify 5'-OH RNA fragments produced
    by these cleavage events, we exploited the unique ligation mechanism of Escherichia coli RtcB
    RNA ligase to attach an oligonucleotide linker to RNAs with 5'-OH termini, followed by steps for
    library construction and analysis by massively parallel DNA sequencing. We applied the method to
    RNA from budding yeast and captured known 5'-OH fragments produced by tRNA Splicing Endonuclease
    (SEN) during processing of intron-containing pre-tRNAs and by Ire1 cleavage of HAC1 mRNA following
    induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We identified numerous novel 5'-OH fragments
    derived from mRNAs. This method enables specific capture of 5'-OH termini and complements existing
    methods for identifying RNAs with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini.

    Ribozymes are small catalytic RNA sequences capable of nucleotide-specific self-cleavage found
    widespread in nature. Ribozyme cleavage generates distinct 2',3'-phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl termini
    that resemble substrates for recently characterized RNA repair pathways in cells. We report that
    ribozyme cleavage of two separate mRNAs activated their scarless trans-ligation and translation
    into full-length protein in eukaryotic cells, a process that we named StitchR (for Stitch RNA).
    Optimization of StitchR activity in mammalian cells resulted in a ~900-fold increase in protein
    expression that approached levels observed for genes expressed from single vectors. We demonstrate
    that StitchR can be harnessed for effective dual adeno-associated virus gene therapies to correct
    muscular dystrophies by restoring large functional muscle proteins to endogenous levels in vivo.

    All genomes have mobile genetic segments called transposable elements (TEs). Here we describe a
    system, which we term SOS splicing, that protects Caenorhabditis elegans and human genes against
    DNA-transposon-mediated disruption by excising these TEs from host mRNAs. SOS splicing, which
    seems to operate independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern-recognition system triggered by
    the base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of DNA
    transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human
    cells: AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges
    RTCB and AKAP17A to allow RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose
    that SOS splicing is a previously undescribed conserved and RNA-structure-directed mode of mRNA
    splicing, and that an identified function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from
    the deleterious effects of DNA-transposon-mediated gene perturbation.

    The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response activated by accumulation of
    misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IRE1 is a key ER stress sensor that possesses
    both kinase and RNase activities. Upon ER stress, IRE1 oligomerizes and activates its RNase domain,
    which splices XBP1 mRNA in the cytoplasm. The spliced XBP1 encodes a transcription factor that
    upregulates genes involved in ER protein folding, quality control, and ER-associated degradation
    (ERAD). The IRE1-XBP1 pathway is conserved from yeast to humans and plays critical roles in
    development, metabolism, and disease.

    Enhancers are cis-regulatory DNA elements that activate transcription of target genes over long
    genomic distances. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs transcribed from active
    enhancers. Super-enhancers are large clusters of enhancers that drive expression of genes that
    define cell identity. Recent studies have revealed that eRNAs play functional roles in gene
    activation by facilitating enhancer-promoter looping, recruiting transcriptional machinery, and
    modulating chromatin accessibility. The study of enhancer biology has important implications for
    understanding development, disease, and gene regulation.
